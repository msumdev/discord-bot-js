# A Node Discord bot

The inspiration behind this project was to be able to ask Alexa a question in a discord voice channel and receive a command. The goal was to be able to have an AI assistant in the channel that also had the ability to have smart commands. Such as playing music or other cool specific things.

Like with my other projects, this was a work in progress and acts more of a proof of concept than an actual working prototype. I will potentially pick this up again in the future.
